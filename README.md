<h1>One Piece Survey Project (from freeCodeCamp)</h1>

<p><strong>Start Date:</strong> 2 September 2025</p>

<p>
This project was created during the <strong>Responsive Web Design</strong> course on 
<em>freeCodeCamp</em>. The goal was to practice HTML forms with different inputs 
(text, email, number, select, radio, checkbox, and textarea) and to organize them 
with semantic elements like <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;legend&gt;</code>.
</p>

<p>
I will come back to this project later to make improvements, such as better styling, 
responsiveness, and accessibility. For now, it is a simple fan survey about 
<strong>One Piece</strong>.
