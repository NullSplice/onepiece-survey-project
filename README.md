<h1>One Piece Survey Project (freeCodeCamp RWD)</h1>

<p><strong>Start Date:</strong> 2 September 2025</p>

<p>
  This project was built as part of the <strong>Responsive Web Design</strong> curriculum on 
  <em>freeCodeCamp</em>. The goal was to practice working with HTML forms while applying 
  semantic structure, accessibility principles, and responsive styling.
</p>

<p>
  The survey theme is inspired by the anime and manga <strong>One Piece</strong>, letting fans 
  share their preferences about characters, arcs, and experiences.
